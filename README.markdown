Ring Signatures Concept
=======================

This application is part of a project developed for the [modern cryptography introduction course](http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~ahevia/cc51q/2009/index.html) in the [Universidad de Chile](http://www.uchile.cl/)

It consists in a little application that signs messages using a basic implementation of [Ring Signatures](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~bssadjad/courses/crypto/leak_secret_rivest.pdf)

The basic idea was to test the idea of signing messages without sending the user's private key to any third-party by storing this information in a local database as is specified in the HTML5 Standard.
